    Tech giant <b>ZenoTech</b> is under fire this week after sustainability watchdogs raised serious concerns over the company’s environmental claims tied to its latest smartphone, the <b>ZenoPhone</b>. Despite flashy marketing campaigns promoting a “greener future,” independent reviews suggest the brand’s eco promises are more smoke than substance — a textbook case of <b>greenwashing</b>.
</p>

<p>
    At its global launch event, ZenoTech declared its commitment to building a sustainable product line and claimed the <b>ZenoPhone</b> was a result of "pioneering green innovation." Central to the campaign was its so-called <b>“sustainable design.”</b>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Claim 1: Vague – “Sustainable Design”</b> 
    <br>
    <i>“We aim to continuously explore optimal ways to build a low-carbon, circular economy and to find innovative solutions that make our value chain greener,”</i> reads the company’s website.
    <br>
    But environmental experts say the language is <b>intentionally vague</b>, with no clear definitions, measurable targets, or timelines. The company does not specify what materials are being used, how emissions are being reduced, or whether the supply chain meets any verifiable green standards.
    <br>
    Worse still, the company boldly claims that the <b>ZenoPhone is made with 100% sustainable materials</b>— a statement that <b>has been flagged as false</b> by independent audits.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Claim 2: False – “100% Sustainable Materials”</b> 
    <br>
    A recent teardown analysis by <b>GreenTech Integrity</b>, a third-party evaluator, found that only <b>a small portion of the materials used were recycled or renewable</b>, while most were conventional plastics and virgin metals with no transparency about their sourcing.
    <br>
    Another claim by the company — that the phone <b>“does not contain banned chemical substances”</b> — has also drawn criticism.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Claim 3: Irrelevant – “No Banned Chemicals”</b> 
    <br>
    <i>“That’s not an environmental achievement,”</i> said Dr. Karina Yu, an environmental science professor at the University of Melbourne. <i>“It’s simply a legal requirement. It’s like bragging that your product isn’t illegal.”</i>
</p>

<p>
    Adding to the controversy, ZenoTech lists several <b>national and international certifications</b> on its product page. However, investigative reporters found that <b>many of these certifications are not verifiable, expired, or linked to organizations with no credibility</b>.
<p>
    <i>“They’re using logos and names that look official, but don’t lead to any legitimate certification body,”</i> said Tina Brown, director of the nonprofit watchdog <b>LabelCheck Asia</b>.
</p>

<p>
   The company also publishes a <b>Product Environmental Report</b> on its website — but experts say it contains no verifiable data, no third-party validation, and lacks transparency in lifecycle assessment methods.
</p>

<p>
    <i>“It’s more of a PR document than a technical report,”</i> said Brown. <i>“There are no certifications attached, no emissions disclosures, and no mention of energy usage or end-of-life treatment.”</i>
</p>

<p>
    Meanwhile, <b>third-party environmental rating agencies</b> have given ZenoTech one of the <b>lowest scores in the industry</b> for its environmental performance, citing excessive use of unrecyclable materials, energy-inefficient production, and lack of take-back or recycling programs.
</p>

<p>
    Consumer advocacy groups are now calling for tighter regulation of environmental claims in tech advertising.
</p>

<p>
    <i>“Consumers deserve honesty,”</i> said Lila Hassan, spokesperson for the <b>FairTech Alliance</b>. <i>“Brands like ZenoTech mislead buyers with buzzwords while doing little to reduce their actual environmental impact.”</i>
</p>

<p>
    As of this writing, ZenoTech has not responded to requests for comment.
